Author: Kevin Sacca (email:kevin.sacca@colorado.edu)

The purpose of this page is to show off data, graphics, videos, and more from my research presented at AGU 2024 that cannot be part of my poster!

AGU ESS Journal Paper Pre-print
==============================

Please head over to ESS OpenArchive to read my latest journal article pre-print titled `Empirical Quantification of Topobathymetric LiDAR System Resolution using Modulation Transfer Function <https://essopenarchive.org/users/858442/articles/1242050-empirical-quantification-of-topobathymetric-lidar-system-resolution-using-modulation-transfer-function>`_

AGU Digital Poster Resource
===========================
`Link to my poster on AGU Online Poster Library <https://agu24.ipostersessions.com/Default.aspx?s=86-E6-C0-64-C7-F4-B5-CB-FE-40-26-D5-F0-59-88-8A>`_

LiDAR Range-Height MTF Code
===========================

The GitHub repository `3DMTF <https://github.com/UCBoulder/3DMTF>`_ contains Python code for calculating range-height MTF from 3D LiDAR point clouds of point source and line source targets.

Simulated Bathymetric LiDAR Data
================================
The data folder here has some .csv point cloud files you can open in a point cloud viewer such as CloudCompare to view.

The simulated bathymetric point cloud data was generated using an instrument sampling model framework with raytracing and a time-dependent, dynamic water surface model.

The example point clouds contain several point-source and line-source targets for computing range-height MTF.
